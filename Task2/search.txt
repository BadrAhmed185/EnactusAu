   1: Display.

 Display is a CSS property that determines how an element is treated as a box and how it interacts with other boxes in the layout.
There are different values for display:
display: inline means the element generates one or more inline boxes that do not break the line before or after them. Inline elements can only have horizontal margins, padding, and borders, and they cannot have a specified width or height. Examples of inline elements are <span>, <a>, and <img>1.

display: inline-block means the element generates an inline-level block container. It is similar to inline, but it allows the element to have vertical margins, padding, and borders, and to have a specified width and height. Inline-block elements can also align themselves along the vertical axis using the vertical-align property1. Examples of inline-block elements are <button> and <input>1.

display: flex means the element generates a block-level flex container. It establishes a flex formatting context for its direct children, which are called flex items. Flex containers can distribute the available space among the flex items, align them along the main and cross axes, and reorder them according to the flex-direction and order properties1. Examples of flex containers are <div> and <ul> with display: flex1.


  2: ID selector.

The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element1.

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. For example, #mainPart selects the element with id="mainPart".
